# Real time voting app

Allows user to vote about a specific topic and see results in real time.

Needs .env file with backend and database url.

Made with Next.js.

You may check it on:

It may be needed to wait about 1 minute after real time showing will work.
It is connected to backend inactivity. 

Should work smoothly after.
